The O
Story O
of O
Pony O

In O
1972 O
the O
Aarnios O
lived O
in O
Tontunmaki O
, O
where O
Eero O
utilized O
their O
garage O
as O
his O
work O
space O
. O
Although O
his O
previous O
pieces O
had O
already O
possessed O
uniqueness O
and O
characteristics O
, O
Eero O
describes O
Pony O
as O
his O
first O
very O
unusual O
design O
. O
He O
thought O
about O
chairs O
. O
One O
can O
sit O
almost O
anywhere O
. O
A O
seat O
doesnt O
even O
have O
to O
be O
a O
chair O
or O
a O
sofa O
. O
One O
can O
sit O
on O
the O
stairs O
, O
on O
a O
rock O
, O
on O
a O
tree O
stump O
, O
on O
a O
horse O
, O
on O
a O
pony O
. O
. O
. O
He O
decided O
to O
design O
a O
soft O
animal O
figure O
, O
which O
you O
could O
sit O
on O
, O
like O
riding O
a O
horse O
. O

In O
1973 O
the O
first O
sketch O
of O
the O
Pony O
was O
sent O
to O
Asko O
Furniture O
company O
, O
who O
was O
the O
main O
producer O
of O
Eero O
Aarnios O
designs O
. O
They O
completed O
the O
basic O
form O
for O
the O
seat O
and O
sent O
it O
by O
bus O
to O
Puumala O
, O
where O
Eero O
continued O
developing O
the O
prototype O
at O
the O
Aarnio O
familys O
summer O
cottage O
. O
Eero O
thought O
the O
first O
mold O
was O
decent O
but O
needed O
enhancing O
. O
In O
the O
country O
side O
, O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
space O
to O
work O
, O
and O
since O
the O
body O
was O
made O
of O
polystyrene O
, O
he O
didnt O
mind O
getting O
his O
hands O
and O
surroundings O
all O
over O
it O
. O
Eero O
bought O
some O
modeling O
clay O
and O
worked O
further O
with O
the O
body O
. O
After O
the O
basic O
form O
was O
finished O
, O
he O
painted O
the O
first O
Pony O
white O
. O

From O
the O
start O
Eero O
knew O
the O
Pony O
needed O
upholstering O
. O
The O
process O
for O
the O
upholsterer O
is O
extremely O
challenging O
and O
difficult O
, O
requiring O
rare O
talent O
in O
hand O
crafting O
. O
As O
a O
result O
, O
one O
can O
only O
admire O
the O
magnificent O
seaming O
, O
intertwining O
together O
with O
the O
form O
of O
the O
body O
and O
flexibility O
of O
the O
fabric O
. O
However O
, O
some O
Ponys O
out O
there O
do O
not O
have O
their O
furs O
. O
Batches O
has O
been O
produced O
of O
concrete O
to O
serve O
as O
road O
blocks O
. O
Ponys O
made O
of O
concrete O
are O
not O
easily O
moved O
around O
, O
since O
they O
weigh O
as O
much O
as O
250kg O
. O

as O
keen O
on O

It O
looks O
like O
a O
childs O
oversized O

designed O
for O
adults O

design O
aesthetics O
have O
a O
certain O
playfulness O
and O
humor O
, O
which O
have O
been O
very O
salient O
in O
his O
creativity O
and O
thinking O
process O
. O
Eero O
believes O
certain O
pieces O
should O
have O
a O
certain O
personality O
, O
one O
that O
suits O
them O
perfectly O
. O
For O

the O
message O
and O
a O
way O
of O
communicating O
for O
Eero O
. O
For O
the O
Pony O
, O
Eero O
prefers O
the O
colors O
green O
and O
white O
. O
Although O
, O
speaking O
from O
experience O
, O
for O
a O
family O
with O
children O
, O
white O
can O
be O
quite O
sensitive O
